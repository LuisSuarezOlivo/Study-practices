# Study-practices

In this repository the idea is to upload those exercises done in the practices of the courses I have been doing.

### Idea

The idea of this page or repository, is to have a place where I can upload the progress I'm having in my practices and study with the courses I've been taking. For now most of the exercises are the basic knowledge that I have learned of various programs and the understanding of the most essential commands for them. 

### Java Script 

In this folder I have had to do very basic projects to understand the basics of programming language.

### PowerBi

In this case we have the handling of certain databases of certain companies in real life and with it the visualization of the data to be able to better understand and create analysis of them in the future.

### python

In this folder I have had to do very basic projects to understand the basics of programming language.

### Website 
In this case, itâ€™s a combination of HTML and CSS used to create a basic main page for a website. These exercises have been helpful in understanding how these tools work.
